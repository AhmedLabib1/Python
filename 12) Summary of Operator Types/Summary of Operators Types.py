#
# [2] Comparison Operators (Rlational Operator) 
# ==============================================
# 1- [==]
# 2- [!=]
# 3- [>]
# 4- [<]
# 5- [>=]
# 6- [<=]
#
# [3] Logical Operators (Boolean operators) 
# ==========================================
# 1- Logical AND: and
# 2- Logical OR: or
# 3- Logical NOT: not
#
# [4] Bitwise Operators (Binary operators) 
# =========================================

# 
# [6] Membership Operators 
# =========================
# These operators test for membership in a sequence (such as strings, lists, or tuples):
# 1- in
# 2- not in
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(3 in list1)  # True
print(6 not in list1)  # True
#
# [7] Identity Operators 
# =======================
# These operators compare the memory locations of two objects:
# 1- is
# 2- not is
list2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
list3 = list2
print(list2 is list3)  # True
